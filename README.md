# Unsupervised-runtime-Image-segmentation


Provided is a matlab code that does image segmentation and edge detection based on a single image. It basically finds enclosed segments with similar colors. 


The algorithm initializes by a simple segmentation. Then it deformes the boundry of the segmentation in a greedy manner (Similar to K means).
